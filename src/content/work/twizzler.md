Collaborating with Professor Owen Arden and peers on a novel operating
system, specifically its security subsystem. Researching
novel ways to incorporate information flow control into OS security
abstractions in order to provide expressivity and stronger security guarantees.
I wrote my [bachelors thesis](../../../public/thesis.pdf) on this topic, 
as well as contributing [several pr's](https://github.com/twizzler-operating-system/twizzler/issues?q=author%3Asuri-codes).
