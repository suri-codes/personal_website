# Vision

A desktop cat that behaves like a pet and allows for simple communication from one person to another.

# Goals
Currently in active development; a majority of my decisions are to 
explore and learn new things, so is what I have in mind currently.


- Only support a peer 2 peer networking implementation

- Either mimic cats on both ends, or have 2 separate cats that can talk with each other

- Learn to use threads to manage multiple processes and communicate properly

- Cute animations
