# Vision

A easy way to communicate between two parties using the terminal.

# Goals
Currently in active development; a majority of my decisions are to 
explore and learn new things, so is what I have in mind currently.

- Provide both a TUI (Terminal User Interface) and a CLI (Command-Line Interface) 
to use the application.

- Support friends and notifications (using os native notification services)

- Try implementing a pure p2p implementation

- Use gRPC as the protocol

- host database myself

- Set up my own server
